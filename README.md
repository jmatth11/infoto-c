# infoto-c

This is a C rewrite of my [infoto](https://github.com/jmatth11/infoto) project that was
originally done in python.

Currently it is in a barebones functioning state. If all inputs are perfect it
works like the python version. I am in the process of handling some TODOs to make
it more robust and to clean up the code base.

TODOs
- finish README
- Create function that can process settings over an array of images.
- See if the code can be cleaned up more.
- Create string structure to clean up string creation.
- revisit ttf glyph writing to find the proper way to handle kerning and white space.

extra:
- Explore pulling EXIF data out of PNG files.
